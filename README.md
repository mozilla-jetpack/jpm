[Jetpack](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Jetpack) Manager for Node.js

Replacing the previous python tool for developing Firefox Add-ons, [cfx](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tools/cfx), jpm is a utility for developing, testing, and packaging add-ons.

**Currently only works with Firefox Nightly**. Check out the `--binary` flag for ensuring that you're using the correct release of Firefox with jpm.

## Install

Installing from npm:

```
npm install jpm -g
```

Installing from GitHub to get latest features or working on jpm itself, use [npm link](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-link.html) to add the `jpm` global to your path:

```
git clone https://github.com/mozilla/jpm.git
cd jpm
npm install
npm link
```

## Usage

`jpm` has several commands: `run`, `xpi`, `init`, `test`, with details below. Some options are:

* `-b, --binary <path>` Use the specified Firefox binary to run the addon. Used in `run` and `test`.
* `-v, --verbose` Prints additional debugging information.
* `--binary-args <CMDARGS>` Passes the additional arguments into Firefox. Multiple arguments must be enclosed in quotes.
* `--debug` Enable the add-on debugger when running the add-on.
* `-p, --profile <PROFILE>` Uses the profile name or path when running Firefox. Paths must start with either "./" or "/", or otherwise assumed to be a profile name.
* `-o, --overload [path]` Uses either the specified `[path]` or the path set in the environment variables `JETPACK_ROOT` as the root for [addon-sdk](https://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk) modules instead of the ones built into Firefox.

### Commands

* `jpm init` Provides a series of prompts to create a `package.json` for an addon.
* `jpm run` Runs the current addon.
* `jpm test` Tests the current addon.
* `jpm xpi` Zips up the current addon into a `.xpi` file.

### Examples

Run current addon with Firefox Nightly on OSX:

```
jpm run -b /Applications/FirefoxNightly.app
```

Turn current addon into a `.xpi` file for deployment and installation

```
jpm xpi
```

Use local checkout of SDK modules for working on the SDK itself.

```
jpm run -o /path/to/addon-sdk
```

## Transitioning From CFX

Currently, any add-on with unspecified engines, or engines supporting versions of Firefox where AOM support for native jetpacks does not exist, jpm will add a `install.rdf` and `bootstrap.js` file for backwards compatability.


## Testing

To run the jpm test suite

```
npm test
```

To run just a specific type of test (functional, unit), run the associated script:

```
npm run unit
```
